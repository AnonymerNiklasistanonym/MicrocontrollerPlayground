# 04_outputs > i2c_lcd_HD44780

Based on the code from [T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD](https://github.com/T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD).

Connecting the HD44780 to the VBUS power output seems to work.
To be safe an external 5V power adapter should be used.

Was tested on a 2004A and 1602 LCD display.

Don't forget to change the contrast if nothing is visible.

When certain tiles/lines are not being displayed try pushing on the display (congrats your LCD is broken just like mine).
